# Ultima Underworld STRINGS.PAK Tools

A collection of Python utilities for analyzing, extracting, and repacking the STRINGS.PAK file from Ultima Underworld games. These tools allow you to examine the structure of the file, extract all game strings, modify them, and repack them into a new STRINGS.PAK file.

## Tools Included

1. **uw-strings-analyzer.py** - Analyzes the structure of STRINGS.PAK, showing the Huffman tree, block information, and more
2. **uw-strings-extractor.py** - Extracts all strings from STRINGS.PAK into a text file
3. **uw-strings-packer.py** - Repacks modified strings back into a new STRINGS.PAK file
4. **uw-strings-translator.py** - Tool for translating Ultima Underworld game text strings using Ollama (for local LLM translation) or Transformers (using Hugging Face's translation models) (more [README_translator.md](/README_translator.md) )

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

Clone this repository or download the scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uw-strings-tools.git
cd uw-strings-tools
```

## Usage

### 1. Analyzing STRINGS.PAK

Use the analyzer to examine the structure of your STRINGS.PAK file:

```bash
python uw-strings-analyzer.py path/to/strings.pak
```

Optional hexdump feature:

```bash
python uw-strings-analyzer.py path/to/strings.pak --hexdump [offset] [length]
```

This will generate a detailed analysis including:
- File header information
- Huffman tree structure
- Block information
- String encoding samples
- File integrity check

The analysis will also be exported to a `strings-analysis.json` file.

### 2. Extracting Strings

To extract all strings from STRINGS.PAK to a text file:

```bash
python uw-strings-extractor.py
```

This assumes `strings.pak` is in the current directory. It will:
- Extract all strings into `uw-strings.txt`
- Save Huffman tree and block metadata to `uw-strings-metadata.json` (needed for repacking)

The extracted file format is:

```
STRINGS.PAK: 123 string blocks.

block: 0001; 15 strings.
0: This is string 0
1: This is string 1
...

block: 0002; 8 strings.
0: Another block string
...
```

### 3. Modifying and Repacking Strings

1. Edit the extracted `uw-strings.txt` file with any text editor
2. Run the packer to create a new STRINGS.PAK file:

```bash
python uw-strings-packer.py
```

The packer will:
- Read the Huffman tree from `uw-strings-metadata.json`
- Parse the modified `uw-strings.txt` file
- Create a new `strings.pak` file
- Verify the created file is readable
- Compare with an original file if available (`original_strings.pak`)

## Notes on Editing Strings

When modifying the extracted strings:
- Keep the `block:` and string index format intact
- You can modify the content of each string
- Use `\n` for line breaks
- Don't remove the ending pipe character (`|`) if present
- Adding new blocks or changing block IDs is not recommended

## Technical Details

STRINGS.PAK uses Huffman compression with the following structure:
- File header with Huffman tree nodes
- Block info table with block IDs and offsets
- Multiple string blocks containing:
  - String count
  - String offset table
  - Huffman-encoded string data
